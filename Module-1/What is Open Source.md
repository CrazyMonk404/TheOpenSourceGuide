## What is Open Source?
The term open source describe software that are available with their source code( set of instructions which are working behind ) which have these three folds to-:
- ***Study:*** User’s are allowed to read and understand the source code. 
- ***Change:*** User's can  modify the source code according to his/her convenience.
- ***Distribute:*** User's can redistribute the source code with proper open source licensing.

***Example****
- Let me give you the example I got from my teacher when I entered into my first class of Open Source
 "Imagine of a restaurant having a open soup policy.In that restaurant the chef instead of a waiter will come to you with a menu but the menu doesn’t contain only the name of the soup but also the recipe of it.
Now you can have all the ingredients of the soup or you can also ask for modification(addition or reduction of ingredients )  according to your taste.
that's what open source is according to ***Sunil Kumar Sir***.
"
## Note: Open Source and freeware both are different
